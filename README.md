# Advent of Code

My answers for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Tooling

All solves done with:
 - [Python3](https://www.python.org/)
 - [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)
 - [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
 - [Jupyter-Vim](https://github.com/jupyter-vim/jupyter-vim)

Also see my [Vim configuration](https://github.com/tovrleaf/vim-files) since 2010.

### Running with my setup

Open terminal and split it vertically. Run `jupyter console` in another one of
them. Run `vim` in other and activate `jupyter-vim` with shortcut `<leader>J`.
Follor instructions from `jupyter-vim` to interpret your code from your editor
to console.
