# Advent of Code /\*2020*/ answers

My answers for [Advent of Code
2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/).

## Tooling

All solves done with:
 - [Python3](https://www.python.org/)
 - [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)
 - [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
 - [Jupyter-Vim](https://github.com/jupyter-vim/jupyter-vim)

Also see my [Vim
configuration](https://github.com/tovrleaf/vim-files) since
2010.

I'm taking this as algorithmic challenge, so no libraries
are used.

### Running with my setup

Open terminal and split it vertically. Run `jupyter
console` in another one of them. Run `vim` in other and
activate `jupyter-vim` with shortcut `<leader>J`. Follor
instructions from `jupyter-vim` to interpret your code from
your editor to console.
